# The following ignore line ignores this link in the source: ../data-sources
#
# MkDocs actually uses an index.md file to generate this,
# but lychee cannot find it from the link and reports it broken.
#
# What lychee tries to resolve in a GitHub Actions runner is:
# file:///home/runner/work/documentation/documentation/data-sources
# which doesn't exist.
#
# The partial checkout path is included:
# * because there's no other easy way to try and generalise,
#   in case someone tries to run this outside of GitHub Actions
# * to try and avoid any false matches,
#   in case a similar URL path is used elsewhere in the documentation
#   (though this is unlikely)
# This line depends on the repository checkout being in `documentation/`.
