The UK Renal Registry (UKRR) contains data on patients under secondary renal care (advanced chronic kidney disease stages 4 and 5, dialysis, and kidney transplantation). The purpose of the UKRR is to audit secondary kidney 
care delivery in the UK especially dialysis and kidney transplant. Data is collected from many different renal IT systems. 

There are 5 different datasets available to OpenSAFELY. These are:

* '2019_prevalence' - a prevalence cohort of patients alive and on RRT in December 2019
* '2020_prevalence' - a prevalence cohort of patients alive and on RRT in December 2020
* '2021_prevalence' - a prevalence cohort of patients alive and on RRT in December 2021
* '2020_incidence' - an incidence cohort of patients who started RRT in 2020
* '2020_ckd' - a snapshot prevalence cohort of patient with Stage 4 or 5 CKD who were reported to the UKRR to be under renal care in December 2020.
