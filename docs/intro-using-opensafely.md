# Introduction to using OpenSAFELY

If this is your first time using OpenSAFELY, we recommend that you:

1. Take a look at our [diagram](how-opensafely-works.md) to gain a high-level understanding of how OpenSAFELY works
2. Follow the [Getting Started](getting-started/index.md) guide, which includes a tutorial to help you get up and running.
3. Then continue on through this section on using OpenSAFELY, starting with the [analysis workflow](worflow.md) which will build upon the knowledge gained from steps 1 and 2.
