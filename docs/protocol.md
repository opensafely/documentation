## Pre-specifying your Research Question and Writing a Study Protocol

Briefly, pre-specifying your research question and developing a study protocol which outlines your methodology is an important open science principle. There are several benefits to developing a protocol:

* It reduces "researcher degrees of freedom" and minimises the risk of questionable research practices such as ["hypothesising after the results are known" (HARKing)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HARKing) or [p-hacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dredging);
* It increases replicability by explaining the “why” of each analytic decision (whereas study code only tells you the “what”);
* It allows you to get feedback from colleagues and potentially identify problems early on in the process, before writing code;
* It forces you to think carefully about your planned analysis before it takes place;
* It can help set a reasonable scope for the project;
* It makes writing the manuscript easier.

Taken together, this can improve both the quality and credibility of your research. Developing a detailed study plan, including figure and table shells, can be particularly helpful when using a federated analytics platform such as OpenSAFELY, as there is less scope for interactively developing these whilst working with the data.

You can choose to pre-register your protocol formally on [OSF](https://osf.io/) or [ENCePP](http://www.encepp.eu/), or informally by uploading and committing "locked" and timestamped protocol versions to GitHub. You can see examples of protocols we've written for OpenSAFELY studies on most of our public repositories — for example [this inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) research repository](https://github.com/opensafely/ics-research/tree/master/protocol) or [this ethnicity research repository](https://github.com/opensafely/ethnicity-covid-research/tree/master/protocol).

If you're interested, two good resources on the benefits, and challenges, of preregistering your research are available [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2019.07.009) and [here](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjebm-2021-111836).
