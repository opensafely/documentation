## Pre-specifying your Research Question and Writing a Study Protocol

!!! note
    This section is a work in progress, and will be further developed.

Briefly, pre-specifying your research question and developing a study protocol which outlines your methodology is an important open science principle. There are several benefits to developing a protocol:

* It reduces "researcher degrees of freedom" and minimises the risk of questionable research practices such as ["hypothesising after the results are known" (HARKing)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HARKing) or [p-hacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dredging);
* It increases replicability by explaining the “why” of each analytic decision (whereas study code only tells you the “what”);
* It allows you to get feedback and identify problems early on in the process, before writing code;
* It can help set limits on what is to be done;
* It makes writing the manuscript easier.

Taken together, this can improve both the quality and credibility of your research. Developing a detailed study plan, including figure and table shells, can be particularly helpful when using a federated analytics platform such as OpenSAFELY, as there is less scope for interactively developing these whilst working with the data.

When working with OpenSAFELY, we recommend using [this protocol template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bmk7MKSK4SiseOR2N_BsDMtx-kHN8u2WRS-gc2C-qhk/edit?tab=t.0). It includes many elements common to frequently used reporting checklists (e.g. STROBE, RECORD). You can choose to pre-register your protocol formally on [OSF](https://osf.io/) or [ENCePP](http://www.encepp.eu/), or informally by uploading "locked" protocol versions to GitHub. You can see examples of protocols we've written for OpenSAFELY studies on most of our public repositories — for example [this inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) research repository](https://github.com/opensafely/ics-research/tree/master/protocol) or [this ethnicity research repository](https://github.com/opensafely/ethnicity-covid-research/tree/master/protocol).
