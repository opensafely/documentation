In this guide, we've documented two different ways to work with OpenSAFELY:

1. *Use an online environment where the needed software is already
   installed for you* (our recommended option).

     Services such as [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) provide online
     computing environments. GitHub Codespaces has a free plan with a generous
     monthly usage limit for working with code in public or
     private repositories. We've adapted our demonstration research
     study and this guide such that you can follow along with GitHub Codespaces,
     should you choose to do so.

     You might prefer an online environment if one or more of the
     following apply:

     * you are investigating what OpenSAFELY offers and want to start
       using it immediately;
     * you do not have administrative access to install software on your
       work computer;
     * you are not sure about whether your computer supports Docker,
       which OpenSAFELY uses;
     * you want to try OpenSAFELY via a device other than a desktop or
       laptop computer, e.g. a tablet.

     To use GitHub Codespaces, the only requirements are:

     * you have a current version of a modern web browser (e.g. Chrome,
       Edge, Firefox, Safari);
     * your internet connection allows access to GitHub Codespaces

     If your internet connection is not managed by you directly —
     perhaps you are in the office or connecting via your employer's
     virtual private network (VPN) — it may be that [corporate firewalls
     prevent access to
     GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-your-connection-to-github-codespaces#browser-cannot-connect);
     please contact the IT staff who manage your internet connection for help.

2. *Install the required software to your own computer*.

     You might prefer a local installation if one or more of the following
     apply:

     * you already have the software required (Docker, Python and Git or
       GitHub Desktop) installed;
     * or you don't already have the required software installed, but
       are comfortable installing and configuring these tools yourself;
     * you want to have more control on the tools you use to develop
       studies for OpenSAFELY.

    Refer to the ["Running OpenSAFELY on your computer" section of this documentation](../../../getting-started/how-to/index.md#running-opensafely-on-your-computer)
    that lists the installation guides.

    The [current local installation guide](../../../getting-started/how-to/index.md#running-opensafely-on-your-computer) is aimed at
    Windows users. Mac users should be able to follow along as well, with
    a few hopefully-obvious alterations; see also the [macOS Install
    Guide](../../../install-macos.md)! We aim to integrate macOS instructions
    into this guide in future.
