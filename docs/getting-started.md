This tutorial will walk you through the minimum steps needed to run an
OpenSAFELY-compliant study against "dummy" (randomly-generated) patient data.
We ask all potential collaborators to successfully complete this tutorial,
before applying to run their project against real data.

This is a first draft of the tutorial, and may have errors or omissions.
Please don't be afraid to ask questions in our [Q&A
forum](https://github.com/opensafely/documentation/discussions)!

## Motivation

OpenSAFELY is designed to allow you to do all of your analytic work on your own
computer, without ever having to access the real, sensitive, patient-level data.

To use the OpenSAFELY framework effectively, you need to:

*  have a few pieces of software available; and
*  understand a few concepts which might be new to you.

## Running OpenSAFELY

### Options for running OpenSAFELY

In this guide, we've documented two different ways to work with OpenSAFELY:

1. *Use an online environment where the needed software is already
   installed for you*.

     Services such as [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io) provide online
     computing environments. Gitpod has a free plan with a generous
     monthly usage limit — 50 hours — for working with code in public or
     private repositories. We've adapted our demonstration research
     study and this guide such that you can follow along with Gitpod,
     should you choose to do so.

     You might prefer an online environment if one or more of the
     following apply:

     * you are investigating what OpenSAFELY offers and want to start
       using it immediately;
     * you do not have administrative access to install software on your
       work computer;
     * you are not sure about whether your computer supports Docker,
       which OpenSAFELY uses;
     * you want to try OpenSAFELY via a device other than a desktop or
       laptop computer, e.g. a tablet.

     To use Gitpod, the only requirements are:

     * you have a current version of a modern web browser (e.g. Chrome,
       Edge, Firefox, Safari);
     * your network connection does not block access to the Gitpod
       development environment.

     If your internet connection is not managed by you directly —
     perhaps you are in the office or connecting via your employer's
     virtual private network (VPN) — it may be that [corporate firewalls
     prevent access to
     Gitpod](https://github.com/opensafely/documentation/discussions/311);
     please contact the IT staff who manage your internet connection for help.

2. *Install the required software to your own computer*.

     You might prefer a local installation if one or more of the following
     apply:

     * you already have the software required (Docker, Python and Git or
       GitHub Desktop) installed;
     * or you don't already have the required software installed, but
       are comfortable installing and configuring these tools yourself;
     * you want to have more control on the tools you use to develop
       studies for OpenSAFELY.

    The [current local installation guide](install-intro.md) is aimed at
    Windows users. Mac users should be able to follow along as well, with
    a few hopefully-obvious alterations; see also the [macOS Install
    Guide](install-macos.md)! We aim to integrate macOS instructions
    into this guide in future.

### Following this Getting Started guide

!!!note
    *Tabbed* sections like the example immediately below split the
    configuration instructions into web browser and local Windows
    installation.  Where these tabbed sections appear, select the
    relevant tab and follow just the instructions for that section.

=== "Web browser (online)"

    These "Web browser" sections will explain how to use OpenSAFELY in a
    web browser via the Gitpod service.

=== "Windows (local)"

    These "Windows" sections will explain how to use OpenSAFELY using
    software installed directly on a Windows machine. These instructions
    are not necessary to follow if you are using a web browser to run
    OpenSAFELY, even if that web browser is running on Windows.

    <h3>Why OpenSAFELY requires several pieces of software to run</h3>

    Some of the software needed is so you can execute code on your computer
    in **exactly the same way** it is run in the secure environment: even a slight
    mismatch in the versions of the software could cause bugs and delays.

    OpenSAFELY is also designed to encourage analysts to adopt best-practice
    software development processes, like using `git` for version control.  If
    you're new to these concepts, there may be quite a lot to learn, and you'll need
    to use further software to work with them. The investment will be worthwhile:
    you'll find your software quality and efficiency will benefit hugely.

    This tutorial is, therefore, a very fast tour through all the **essential**
    components required to get up and running. When you've finished, you'll have
    all the basics in place to continue your learning.

=== "Linux (local)"

    Installation instructions aimed towards Debian and Ubuntu users.
    These instructions will be brief as a level of background knowledge is
    assumed.

## 1. Set up GitHub

To use OpenSAFELY, you must have a GitHub account. GitHub is a widely-used
website for storing and collaborating on software, using the version control
software `git`. GitHub is where your open, reproducible research will be
published.

### Creating a GitHub account

If you do not already have a GitHub account, you should create one
first.

=== "Web browser (online)"

    Visit [GitHub](https://github.com) and click the "Sign up" button.
    You will have to provide an email address and password. GitHub will
    also send you a confirmation email containing a link that you need
    to visit to confirm your account.

=== "Windows (local)"

    It is possible to follow the "Web browser" instructions and simply
    sign up on GitHub's site.

    If you [install GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), the
    GitHub Desktop installation process will also walk you through the
    process of creating an account, if you don't already have one.

    If you already have a GitHub account, GitHub have guides on
    authenticating an existing account with [GitHub
    Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/authenticating-to-github).

    (If you already have `git` configured and are reasonably confident using
    it, GitHub Desktop is not required. You need to be able to `clone` the
    template repository that you will create, then `add`, `commit` and
    `push` changes to that repository to GitHub.)

=== "Linux (local)"

    To install git:
    `sudo apt install git`

#### Securing your GitHub account

We recommend that you [secure your GitHub account with two-factor
authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa).

## 2. Create a new repository in GitHub

Here, you'll copy our OpenSAFELY research template to your own GitHub
account, for developing your own study:

1. Click on the link below to create new repository based from our template.
   You may need to log in to GitHub if you are not already logged in:
   <br><a href="https://github.com/opensafely/research-template/generate" target="_blank">https://github.com/opensafely/research-template/generate</a>.
1. Use the **Owner** drop-down menu, and select the account you want to own the
   repository (typically under your own account)
   ![Entering a name, owner and description, when creating a repository from the research template.](images/create-repository-owner-name.png)
1. Type a name for your repository, and an optional description.
1. Choose a repository visibility.  This would usually be "Public".
   ![Entering a description and choosing to make a repository public or private, when creating a repository from the research template.](images/create-repository-public-private.png)
1. There is an "Include all branches" option: it can be left disabled.
   (You only need the main branch; the other branches are
   work-in-progress changes.)
1. Click **Create repository from template**
1. The new GitHub repository will take a moment to initialise, as it is running
   some setup in background. Wait about 1 minute, then reload the page, and you
   should see the README displayed now reflects the name you gave to the new
   repository.
1. Once created, select the "Settings" tab and scroll down to the option to the option to "Automatically delete head branches". This should be turned ON so that when you merge a branch it is automatically deleted, keeping your branches neat and tidy. Deleted branches can be restored if needed later.

   If you see `${GITHUB_REPOSITORY_NAME}` in your README, the repo is not yet initialised, wait a few seconds longer and reload.


## 3. Setup the required software

<!-- The generated table of contents does not dynamically adjust according to selected tab for tabbed contents. Use actual heading tags to prevent headings in tabbed sections from appearing in the table of contents. -->
=== "Web browser (online)"

    <h3>Open your repository with Gitpod</h3>

    For the repository you just created, there should be a `Gitpod: ready to
    code` button displayed in the README.  Click on that button to open your
    new repository in Gitpod.

    If it is the first time you have used Gitpod, you'll see a "Log in" screen.
    You can use your GitHub account to login to Gitpod: click "Continue with
    GitHub".

    A Gitpod workspace containing the Visual Studio code editor with a
    command-line interface "terminal" should then appear. **This may take
    a little bit longer the first time a workspace is started, perhaps
    30 seconds to a minute.**

    ![Gitpod's workspace showing the editor, terminal and
    Explorer.](images/gitpod-workspace.png)

    The terminal at the bottom-right of the Gitpod workspace runs
    commands on a computer (virtual machine) provided by Gitpod.

    The large, upper-right area holds the **main editor** and where you will
    view and edit files that you are working on. The left **"side bar"**
    holds the Explorer when you first start the workspace. There are
    other useful menus in this area that can be switched with the icons
    to the far left side. Finally, the button at the top-left with three
    horizontal lines (`≡`) is the **menu button**, which allows you to
    access many more options.

    If you find yourself using Gitpod regularly for working on research,
    we have a brief guide to [managing Gitpod
    workspaces](gitpod-workspaces.md).

    <h3>Running **opensafely**</h3>

    The `opensafely` software should already be installed if you start
    Gitpod for the OpenSAFELY research template.

    You can confirm this by typing `opensafely` in the terminal at the
    prompt `$` and pressing ++enter++. You should see an output that looks
    something like:

    ```
    $ opensafely
    usage: opensafely [-h] [--version] COMMAND ...

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help  show this help message and exit
      --version   show program's version number and exit

    available commands:

      COMMAND
	help      Show this help message and exit
	run       Run project.yaml actions locally
	codelists
              Commands for interacting with https://codelists.opensafely.org/
	pull      Command for updating the docker images used to run OpenSAFELY studies locally
	upgrade   Upgrade the opensafely cli tool.
    ```

=== "Windows (local)"

    To develop an OpenSAFELY study on your own computer, you will need to install a
    few things. Most important is the `opensafely` tool; to install this, you must
    (currently) first install the Python programming language.

    <h3>Install Python and **opensafely**</h3>

    1. [Download and run the Anaconda Python
       installer](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/).
    1. When you've done, to verify your installation, open Anaconda Prompt by
       clicking Start, search, or selecting Anaconda Prompt (or Anaconda Powershell)
       from the menu. ![Finding Anaconda Prompt on
       Windows](./images/win-anaconda-prompt.png)
    1. To install the OpenSAFELY command line tool, you first need to
       install a tool called `pip`. ([`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
       is used for installing Python software and libraries.)
       Do this by typing `conda install pip` and pressing ++enter++.
    1. Now you can install the OpenSAFELY command line tool, by typing `pip
       install opensafely`, and pressing ++enter++. You should see a message
       to the effect of `Successfully installed opensafely`.
    1. To confirm everything is working, type `opensafely` and press
       ++enter++. If the OpenSAFELY tool is working, this will show help
       text on how to use the `opensafely` command.

    <h3>Install Docker</h3>

    !!! note
        On Windows, installing Docker is usually
        straightforward, but can sometimes be complicated, depending on your exact
        version and configuration of Windows. If you run into problems, our more
        [detailed installation notes](install-docker.md) may help.


    1. Follow the [Docker for windows installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/).
       If you are using Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise or Education, you should
       follow the instructions for Hyper-V backend and Windows containers.  If you are using
       Windows Home or an earlier build of Pro or Education, follow the instructions for
       WSL 2 backend.
       Unfortunately, we've had reports that installing in Windows Home can
       be very challenging. Please let us know if you can help us [improve
       the documentation](updating-the-docs.md) here.
    1. Starting Docker can take a while &mdash; up to 5 minutes. While it's doing
       so, an animation runs in the notification area:<br>
       ![The Docker icon in the Windows notification area.](images/win-docker-starting.png)
    1. When Docker has finished starting up, share your hard drive with Docker:
       click the system tray docker icon; select "settings"; select "shared drives".
    1. If you have ended up with the *Hyper-V* backend, then when Docker has
       finished starting up, you will need share your hard drive with Docker: click
       system tray docker icon; select "settings"; select "shared drives".  This
       setting does not exist in the *WSL 2* backend.
    1. Test Docker and opensafely work together. Open an Anaconda Prompt, and run
       `opensafely pull cohortextractor`. This will pull down the OpenSAFELY
       cohortextractor images, which can be used to run actions in your study.  The
       first time you run it, this may take a little time, depending on your
       network connection. It is downloading a reproducible environment identical
       to that installed in the OpenSAFELY secure environment.

=== "Linux (local)"

    1. Install Python, pip (Python package manager), and Docker
    `sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3 python3-pip docker`
    1. Install the *opensafely* Python package
    `pip3 install opensafely`
    1. Test opensafely and Docker
    `opensafely pull cohortextractor`

## 4. Set up your first study

In a previous step, you created a copy of the research code
in GitHub. You need to have a copy, or "clone", of that code to develop your own
study.

### Clone the study code to your computer

=== "Web browser (online)"

    There's nothing to do here! When you open the Gitpod workspace, the
    associated code from GitHub will already be cloned and available in the code
    editor. You'll see the files and folders in the Explorer.

=== "Windows (local)"

    Please follow [GitHub's instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop)
    for cloning the study code with GitHub Desktop.

=== "Linux (local)"

    Visit your github page to find the name of your opensafely repository. On your github
    homepage, this will be in the *repositories* tab at the top. Then select the green *Code*
    button. Select *SSH* then *copy to clipboard*. You can then clone this using this command:

    `git clone <repository name>`

### Test the blank study on your computer

=== "Web browser (online)"

    There's nothing to do here! In the following sections, just type any
    `opensafely` commands in the terminal available at the bottom-right of the
    Gitpod workspace. Copy the commands and then press ++enter++ to run them.

=== "Windows (local)"

    You can open a prompt to run the study code:

    1. Open Anaconda Prompt (or use an already-open one)
    1. Change your current directory to the location of your cloned, local path. To
       do this, use the `cd` command. For example, `cd
       C:/Users/me/my-git-repos/hello-world` and press ++enter++.

    Run the `opensafely` commands in the Anaconda Prompt. In Windows, note that
    the command-line prompt may be something like `>` instead of `$`; any
    commands written here with the `$` prompt will also work on Windows.

### Run your first study

Now you're ready to run your first study. Ensure your current directory is your newly-cloned
study repository, and run:

```sh
$ opensafely run run_all
```

pressing ++enter++ once you've typed the command.

The first time you run this command, it may take a while to download the
required software. Eventually, you should see output that ends something like
this:

```shell-session
<...several lines of output...>
generate_study_population: Extracting output file: output/input.csv
generate_study_population: Completed successfully
generate_study_population: Cleaning up container and volume

=> generate_study_population
Completed successfully

log file: metadata/generate_study_population.log
outputs:
 output/input.csv  - highly_sensitive
```
The final line tells you a file of (randomly-generated) patient data has been created at
`output/input.csv`, and that it should be considered highly sensitive
data. What you see here is exactly the same process that would happen on a real, secure
server.

This is what the `input.csv` should look like:

```
patient_id
```

**Because we haven't modified the template blank study yet, this CSV file is
still empty &mdash; we'll generate *dummy data* that contains no real patient
information in the next section.**

### Accessing files

=== "Web browser (online)"

    The Visual Studio Code editor has a file Explorer that you can use
    to browse the files and appears when first starting the Gitpod
    workspace. It is accessed by the file icon in the bar on the
    left-hand side of the editor.

    Clicking on a file name in the Explorer will open the file in a tab
    within the editor.

=== "Windows (local)"

    The new output files are created in the local copy of the
    repository in the `output/` directory, e.g. `C:/Users/me/my-git-repos/hello-world/output/`.

## 5. Make changes to your study

You've successfully run the code in your study, but at the moment it just creates an empty output
file. Now we'll add some code to do something slightly more interesting.

### Visual Studio Code as a code editor

In order to write code in the OpenSAFELY framework, a code editor will
make your life much easier. The steps here use Visual Studio Code.
Gitpod users already use Visual Studio Code by default in workspaces.

Visual Studio Code is also available free of charge for Windows, macOS
and Linux. If you are working on your own computer and **not** in
Gitpod, and are already comfortable using another code editor, then that
editor will be suitable.

Here we'll only use Visual Studio Code as a simple editor. There are
several [short videos and written
guides](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs#first-steps) elsewhere on how
to use more of Visual Studio Code's features.

**By default, the Visual Studio Code configuration we provide will
automatically save the edits to files that you make.**

=== "Web browser (online)"

    There's nothing to do here! When you open a Gitpod workspace, Visual
    Studio Code is ready to use as the default editor and has your
    research repository opened.

=== "Windows (local)"

    Download and install [Visual Studio
    Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Then start Visual
    Studio Code and use the menu to open your research repository
    (**File > Open Folder...**)

### Add an `age` column

1. The "Explorer" on the left hand side lists the files and folders in
   your research repository. Find and click on the `study_definition.py`
   file inside the `analysis` folder. This file specifies the population
   that you'd like to study (dataset rows) and what you need to know
   about them (dataset columns).
1. Add some text so that the file looks like this (new text highlighted):
```python linenums="1" hl_lines="14 15 16 17 18 19 20"
from cohortextractor import StudyDefinition, patients, codelist, codelist_from_csv  # NOQA


study = StudyDefinition(
    default_expectations={
        "date": {"earliest": "1900-01-01", "latest": "today"},
        "rate": "uniform",
        "incidence": 0.5,
    },
    population=patients.registered_with_one_practice_between(
        "2019-02-01", "2020-02-01"
    ),

    age=patients.age_as_of(
        "2019-09-01",
        return_expectations={
            "rate": "universal",
            "int": {"distribution": "population_ages"},
        },
    ),
)

```
Line 10 means "*I'm interested in all patients who have never changed practice,
between these two dates*"; lines 14-15 "*Give me a column of data corresponding
to the age of each patient on the given date*"; and lines 16-18 "*I expect
every patient to have a value, and the distribution of ages to match that of the
real UK population*"
3. If you run:

   ```sh
   $ opensafely run run_all
   ```

   you'll see the command does nothing (because there's already a file at `output/input.csv`):

   ```shell-session
   => All actions already completed successfully
   Use -f option to force everything to re-run
   ```

   We can use the `--force-run-dependencies` (or `-f`) option to force
   the CSV file to be created again.

   ```
   $ opensafely run run_all --force-run-dependencies
   ```

   A new `input.csv` file will be created in the `output` folder. Open that
   file (by left-clicking the filename in Visual Studio Code's Explorer, or
   software like Excel). This time, you'll see it now contains synthetic data: an age
   for 1000 randomly generated patients (we'll see shortly how this is defined).

### Add a chart

**Every** study starts with a *study definition* like the one you just edited.
When executed, a study definition generates a CSV of patient data.

A real analysis will have several further steps after this. Each step is defined
in a separate file, and can be written in [any of the programming languages supported in
OpenSAFELY](actions-scripts.md). In this tutorial, we're going to draw a
histogram of ages, using either four lines of Python or just a few more lines of R.

=== "Python"

    1. Right-click on the `analysis` folder in the editor's Explorer and select
       "New file". Type "report.py" as the filename and press ++enter++.
    2. Add the following to `report.py`:.
    ```python
    import pandas as pd

    data = pd.read_csv("output/input.csv")

    fig = data.age.plot.hist().get_figure()
    fig.savefig("output/descriptive.png")
    ```

=== "R"

    1. Right-click on the `analysis` folder in the editor's Explorer and select
       "New file". Type "report.R" as the filename and press ++enter++.
    2. Add the following to `report.R`:.
    ```R
    library('tidyverse')

    df_input <- read_csv(
      here::here("output", "input.csv"),
      col_types = cols(patient_id = col_integer(),age = col_double())
    )

    plot_age <- ggplot(data=df_input, aes(df_input$age)) + geom_histogram()

    ggsave(
      plot= plot_age,
      filename="descriptive.png", path=here::here("output"),
    )
    ```

This code reads the CSV of patient data, and saves a histogram of ages to a new file.

<ol start=3>
  <li>
    Open <code>project.yaml</code> in the editor. This file will be near the end of the
    list of files and folders. This file describes how each step in your analysis should
    be run. It already defines the expected <code>population_size</code> (1000), and a
    single <code>generate_study_population</code> action which defines the output that
    we've generated so far. This file is in a format called YAML: the way it's indented
    matters, so be careful to copy and paste the following carefully.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add a <code>describe</code> action to the file, so the entire file looks like this:
  </li>
</ol>

=== "Python"

    ```yaml linenums="1" hl_lines="15 16 17 18 19 20"
    version: "3.0"

    expectations:
      population_size: 1000

    actions:
      generate_study_population:
        run: cohortextractor:latest generate_cohort --study-definition study_definition
        outputs:
          highly_sensitive:
            cohort: output/input.csv
	    ## note: when running studies for real it is recommended to add the option --output-format='csv.gz' to the run command,
	    ## and add '.gz' to the output file path, to produce the output in compressed form to reduce file size.

      describe:
        run: python:latest python analysis/report.py
        needs: [generate_study_population]
        outputs:
          moderately_sensitive:
            cohort: output/descriptive.png
    ```

=== "R"

    ```yaml linenums="1" hl_lines="15 16 17 18 19 20"
    version: "3.0"

    expectations:
      population_size: 1000

    actions:
      generate_study_population:
        run: cohortextractor:latest generate_cohort --study-definition study_definition
        outputs:
          highly_sensitive:
            cohort: output/input.csv
	    ## note: when running studies for real it is recommended to add the option --output-format='csv.gz' to the run command,
	    ## and add '.gz' to the output file path, to produce the output in compressed form to reduce file size.

      describe:
        run: r:latest analysis/report.R
        needs: [generate_study_population]
        outputs:
          moderately_sensitive:
            cohort: output/descriptive.png
    ```

Line 15 tells the system we want to create a new action called `describe`. Line
16 says how to run the script (using the `python` or `R` runner). Line 17 tells the
system that this action depends on the outputs of the
`generate_study_population` being present. Lines 18-20 describe the files that
the action creates. Line 19 says that the items indented below it are
*moderately* sensitive, that is they may be released to the public after a
careful review (and possible redaction). Line 20 says that there's one output
file, which will be found at `output/descriptive.png`.
5. At the command line, type `opensafely run run_all
   --force-run-dependencies` and press ++enter++.  This should end by
   telling you a file containing the histogram has been
   created. Open it — you can do this via Visual Studio Code's Explorer
   — and check it looks right.

## 6. Test your study on GitHub

Now that your study does something interesting, you should "*push*" it
to GitHub, where it can be viewed by others. Your repository is
automatically configured with tests to verify the project is runnable,
each time you push.

In this section, you will first add the study changes that you've made
to a new *commit* in your repository — a commit represents a stored
version of your work — and then send that commit to GitHub by *pushing*
the new commit.

    <h3>Allow Gitpod to be able to push your changes to GitHub</h3>

    1. When logged into Gitpod, visit the [main Settings page](https://gitpod.io/settings).
       (Note this is different to the settings in your Gitpod workspace.)

    1. Select Integrations and under Git Providers, hover over your
       GitHub details, click the three vertical dots (`⋮`) and select
       "Edit Permissions".

       ![Opening Gitpod's settings in their code
       editor.](images/gitpod-git-providers.png)
    1. In the list, tick "public\_repo", which gives
       your Gitpod account "write access to code in public repositories
       and organizations" on GitHub. (There is another permission that
       you have to enable for access to code in private repositories,
       though this is not necessary for this walkthrough.)

       ![Opening Gitpod's settings in their code
       editor.](images/gitpod-edit-permissions.png)
    1. When you select "Update Permissions", you will see a prompt from
       GitHub asking you to approve the changes, which you will need to
       do to allow Gitpod to push your work on Gitpod to GitHub.

    <h3>Add your changes to the local repository</h3>

    (If you know how to use command-line Git, this works within
    Gitpod's terminal if you do not want to use Visual Studio Code's
    Source Control feature.)

    Back in the Gitpod workspace, open the Source Control panel by
    selecting the icon that has round dots connected by lines on the
    left-hand side. It should be below the magnifying glass icon.

    ![Opening Source Control in
    Gitpod.](images/gitpod-source-control.png)

    When files in the repository are edited and then saved, Source
    Control should list those changes. Note that Gitpod's Visual Studio
    Code has Auto Save enabled by default. If you left-click on a file
    in Source Control, you'll see how your copy of the file has changed
    from the previous repository state. If you hover over a file in
    Source Control under "Changes", you can propose to add the changes
    to the repository by clicking the `+` icon next to the filename.
    These "staged" changes then appear in the "Staged Changes" section.

    ![Staging changes in Gitpod.](images/gitpod-stage-changes.png)

    Staged changes are changes that you are proposing to include in the next *commit* of
    this study repository. These could be modifications of existing
    files or entirely new files that you include.

    It is also possible to "Unstage Changes" if you accidentally stage a
    file that you do not want to include. You can do this by hovering
    over a file listed in the "Staged Changes" section and clicking the
    `-` icon next to the filename.

    ![Unstaging changes in Gitpod.](images/gitpod-unstage-changes.png)

    When you've finished staging all your changes, you are now ready to
    make the new commit. Type a message into the text box above the list
    of staged files that will describe the staged changes. When ready, you
    can then click the tick icon that will *commit* the staged changes to
    to add them to the repository as stored in the workspace.

    ![Committing changes in Gitpod.](images/gitpod-commit.png)

    <h3>Push the changes to GitHub</h3>

    The changes have been stored as a new commit in the workspace's
    *local* copy of the repository. We now need to *push* the
    repository to GitHub to make the changes show up there.

    Click the ellipsis (`⋯`) icon next to "Source Control" and then
    select "Push". This should submit your changes to the GitHub
    repository that you created earlier.

    ![Pushing changes to GitHub.](images/gitpod-push-to-github.png)

    (You may see a prompt: "Would you like Code to periodically run `git
    fetch`?" You can ignore this or select "Ask me later" for the
    purposes of this demonstration.)

=== "Windows (local)"

    <h3>Push the changes to GitHub with GitHub Desktop</h3>

    1. Open GitHub Desktop to view your repository. When you make changes to files in
       your text editor and save them locally, you also see the changes in
       GitHub Desktop. To add all changes in all files to a single "*commit*", tick the
       checkbox at the top of the list.<br>
      ![Committing files with GitHub Desktop.](images/commit-all.png)
    1. At the bottom of the list of changes, in the **Summary** field, type a short,
       meaningful description of the changes (this is called the *commit message*).
       Optionally, you can add more information about the change in the
       **Description** field. Press the blue button to make the commit.<br>
      ![Writing a commit message with GitHub Desktop.](images/commit-message.png)
    1. Click **Push origin** to push your local changes to the remote repository on
       GitHub ![Pushing changes to GitHub with GitHub Desktop.](images/push-to-github.png)

### Check that the automated tests pass

Visit your repository on GitHub's site. Click on the **Actions** tab
![The GitHub Actions tab in a repository.](images/github-actions-tab.png)

You'll see a *Workflow* running with the *commit message* of your last
commit. The workflow verifies that the command `opensafely run run_all` can
run successfully. If it's yellow, it's still running. If it's red, it
has failed. If it's green, it has succeeded. You want it to be green!

## 7. Next steps

Congratulations! You've covered all the basics that you need to develop a study
on your own computer, verify that it can run against real data, and publish it
to GitHub.

To write a real study and run it against actual patient data, you will first
need to get permission for your project from NHS England, the data controllers
for OpenSAFELY's data. [Read about our pilot onboarding programme
here](https://www.opensafely.org/onboarding-new-users/).  Once approved, your
Github user account will be added to our `opensafely` Github organisation, along
with your study repository, which gives you the ability to run your study
against real data.  [Read more about permissions here](permissions.md).

In the meantime, take a look at the rest of our documentation for more
detail on the subjects covered in this tutorial. For example:

* There is a more complete [guide to the OpenSAFELY command-line
  tool](opensafely-cli.md).
* The [full study definition reference](study-def.md) describes all the
  different ways to define new variables in your study definition.
    * *Try adding a new variable such as [Sex](study-def-variables.md#cohortextractor.patients.sex)
    or [Region](study-def-variables.md#cohortextractor.patients.registered_practice_as_of) to the
    study definition you created using this guide, then plot some new charts!*
* You'll find more information about the contents of `project.yaml` in the
  [Actions reference](actions-intro.md).
* OpenSAFELY walkthroughs (see [this notebook](https://github.com/opensafely/os-demo-research#opensafely-demo-materials))
  to guide you through the platform workflow on your own computer with dummy data, rather than using the documentation pages alone
* There is a final step we've not described here: [a
  website](https://jobs.opensafely.org/) called the ["OpenSAFELY Job
  Server"](job-server.md) where you can submit your repository actions to be run
  automatically within the secure EHR vendor environments. Right now you can
  only use this to run real jobs, but we're working on adding the ability to
  test your repository against dummy data.
* You'll be using `git` and GitHub a lot, and it's a critical but complex part
  of the OpenSAFELY ecosystem. If you're not familiar with these concepts, it's
  a good idea to read our [git workflow page](git-workflow.md) and its linked content.
