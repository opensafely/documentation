## Onboarders

When your project has been approved by NHS England, we will agree an intensive support period with you when our statisticians and engineers will be made available to get you started.

## Q&A Forum

If you're outside the onboarding support period, or you're just trying OpenSAFELY out, your first port of call should be our [Q&A forum](https://github.com/opensafely/documentation/discussions) in GitHub. Before asking for help here, please search the [Q&A forum](https://github.com/opensafely/documentation/discussions) and these documentation pages to check that your query hasn’t already been addressed. Some of the most common issues that users face when using OpenSAFELY are listed in the [FAQ page](https://github.com/opensafely/documentation/discussions/445) on the Q&A.

## Bug reports and feature requests

OpenSAFELY uses GitHub to manage and share code and other platform resources. If you want to request any changes to the platform then GitHub issues should be your first port of call.

Issues can be submitted for lots of different things &mdash; new variables or other features, bug reports, additional R or Stata packages, documentation updates, and so on.  All our core software packages live in the [opensafely-core](https://github.com/opensafely-core/) GitHub organisation.

The most common requests are about library support, and new study definition variables. We have a whole page describing [how to request new libraries](requesting-libraries.md), and another about [how to request new study variables](requesting-variables.md). If you want to report bugs or request features in the `opensafely` command-line tool, you can do so in [its own dedicated issue tracker](https://github.com/opensafely-core/opensafely-cli/issues).

Other than this, you will need to choose the most appropriate repo to submit an issue. If you're not sure where to submit your issue, just ask a question in our [Q&A forum](https://github.com/opensafely/documentation/discussions) and we can point you to the right place.
