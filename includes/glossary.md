*[SUS]: Secondary Uses Service - NHS hospital activity data pseudonymised and used for purposes other than direct care, such as analytics and service planning
*[ECDS]: Emergency Care Data Set - the national data set for urgent and emergency care
*[SNOMED CT]: SNOMED Clinical Terms, a structured clinical vocabulary for use in an electronic health record, the current standard for coding in the NHS and many jurisdictions globally

*[ICNARC]: Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre
*[ICNARC-CMP]: data on covid-related intensive care admissions in England
*[CPNS]: Covid-19 Patient Notification System - the route by which NHS England are informed of COVID-19-positive, deaths in hospital
*[ONS]: Office for National Statistics - the UK's largest independent producer of official statistics and the recognised national statistical institute of the UK
*[Level 3]: intermediate data, required for running a study, which may contain identifiable information, and which should never be considered for publication; usually a CSV produced from a study definition. Most OpenSAFELY users will not have (or need) permission to see this data directly
*[Level 4]: tables, figures, and other structured files produced as a result of the analysis of Level 3 data, for example summary statistics and statistical models. OpenSAFELY users with the appropriate permission can view this data, and publish it to the internet if they consider it safe to do so
*[TPP]: The company behind the SystmOne EHR
*[APCS]: Admitted Patient Care Statistics - the national data set for in-patient hospital admissions across England.
*[OPA]: Outpatient Attendances is the national data set for hospital outpatient appointments. It is part of HES
*[EMIS]: EMIS Health, formerly known as Egton Medical Information Systems
*[CLI]: Command-line interface, a text interface used by some computer software that is usually run via a "terminal" or "command-line shell".
*[2FA]: Two-factor authentication, a means of verifying a user is authorised to access a service by checking for something that only the user should know (e.g. a password) and something the user should have (e.g. an authenticator application installed on the user's phone).
*[API]: Application Programming Interface. An agreed way for one system to communicate with another system.
*[released outputs]: files from Level 4 uploaded to the Jobs site.
*[draft published outputs]: a collection of released outputs prepared for publication to the general public.
*[dataset definition]: Describes, using ehrQL, the EHR data to extract from a backend.
*[ehrQL]: The Electronic Health Records Query Language. A Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for EHR data.
*[data provider]: an operator of a database (in UK data protection law, a data processor) that contains sensitive patient data; who also provides a secure infrastructure for running OpenSAFELY next to that data.
*[CKD]: Chronic kidney disease
*[RRT]: Renal replacement therapy
*[UKRR]: UK Renal Registry
