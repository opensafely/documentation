!!! warning
    A "consultation" as returned by this function may not neccesarily be a traditional in-person or even remote consultation between a health care professional and patient.
    Simple administrative tasks such as updating a patient's details may also cause creation of a "consultation" record.
    As such, careful consideration must be given to usage of variables derived from this function within studies as not to overestimate the frequency of consultations.
