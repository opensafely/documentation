!!! warning
    A "consultation" as returned by this function may not actually be a consultation between a health care professional and patient.

    For example, simple administrative tasks such as updating a patient's details may also cause creation of a "consultation" record.

    It is, therefore, extremely unlikely you can use this field to infer anything about real clinician-patient interactions, and it is even more difficult to compare activity between practices as recording behaviour can vary. Some EHRs even delete consultation data for a patient when they switch practice.
